- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kdamayanti
I'm currently retraining as a UI/UX designer. 
I've just graduated as a UI/UX Designer and I'm still learning in the digital world! 
I'm currently continuing my adventure with Sayna to keep learning.
As I said, I love learning and giving myself challenges. 
I'm always open if you'd like to collaborate with me. 
I'd like to have more experience so that I can regain my confidence in this field, so I'm always available if you'd like to talk to me.
